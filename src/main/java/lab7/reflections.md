In my program, I used dependency injection by giving the searchRecipes method a DataService object instead of making one inside the method. This makes the code easier to test and change. In the tests, I used mocks by making fake data with lambda expressions, so I could test different situations. I used the DataService interface, which lets me use different versions of data services that all have the same method. This is called polymorphism — it means I can use different objects in the same way. This also helps decouple the code, so it doesn’t depend too much on one specific thing like a real database. It makes the program easier to test and update.
