## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Hello World Java Program
- **Objective:** Create a simple Java program to take user input, check the number, and save the result to a file.

## Date: 15 January 2025

### Progress:
- **Step 1:** I started by creating a simple "Hello World" program to print text on the screen.
- **Step 2:** I added a part where the user can enter their name and a number.
- **Step 3:** I used an `if-else` statement to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Step 4:** I used a loop to print the number 5 times.
- **Step 5:** I added a list to store the number multiple times and printed the list.
- **Step 6:** I added a feature to write the userâ€™s name and numbers to a file and handle errors with a try-catch block.

### Challenges:
- I had problems writing to the file, but I solved them using a try-catch block to handle errors.
- It was hard to make the output clear on the screen, but I fixed it by using simple print statements.

### Next Steps:
- Finish testing the program and check for any problems.
- Try adding more features like checking if the number is a valid input.
