## Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Hello World Java Program
- **Objective:** Create a simple Java program to take user input, check the number, and save the result to a file.

## Date: 15 January 2025

### Progress:
- **Step 1:** I started by creating a simple "Hello World" program to print text on the screen.
- **Step 2:** I added a part where the user can enter their name and a number.
- **Step 3:** I used an `if-else` statement to check if the number is positive, negative, or zero.
- **Step 4:** I used a loop to print the number 5 times.
- **Step 5:** I added a list to store the number multiple times and printed the list.
- **Step 6:** I added a feature to write the userâ€™s name and numbers to a file and handle errors with a try-catch block.

### Challenges:
- I had problems writing to the file, but I solved them using a try-catch block to handle errors.
- It was hard to make the output clear on the screen, but I fixed it by using simple print statements.

### Next Steps:
- Finish testing the program and check for any problems.
- Try adding more features like checking if the number is a valid input.

### Project Overview
**Project Name:** Avatar Generator  
**Objective:** Improve the readability and maintainability of the `AvatarGenerator` program by adding meaningful comments and JavaDoc documentation.  
**Date:** 28 January 2025

### Progress
- Reviewed the existing Java code and identified areas that required better explanations.
- Added JavaDoc comments for each method, detailing its purpose, parameters, preconditions, and postconditions.
- Improved inline comments to explain key parts of the program, such as HTTP requests, GUI setup, and error handling.
- Ensured that comments followed a consistent format and aligned with Java best practices.
### Challenges
- Understanding the flow of the program before writing comments required careful reading of the code.
- Deciding what level of detail to include in the comments without making them redundant.
- Ensuring that JavaDoc syntax was correctly formatted to generate proper documentation. 

### Next Steps
- Verify the JavaDoc documentation by generating and reviewing the output.
- Check if additional clarification is needed for any complex parts of the code.
- Apply the same documentation approach to future projects for better code quality.
